                        <p>Your Dockerfile is written, your Java app is packed into an image, and your containers run
                            successfully. Do you have an uneasy feeling that youâ€™ve missed something or that something
                            might be wrong? This talk will leave you with the knowledge you need to be confident in your
                            Java container images.</p>

                        <p>This session is a must for any Java developer under the pressure of high-performance
                            expectations and tight deadlines in a cloud-native architecture. To that end, we have
                            learned to make use of a variety of tools and abstractions to help move us along the path to
                            production quickly and effectively. There is a rapidly and continuously evolving ecosystem
                            that sustains the forward march of microservice architectures and their deployments. But,
                            there's a dark side to using these tools in a rush to the finish line. Without taking a step
                            back to understand what's happening below the surface, we can find ourselves stumbling in
                            areas concerning quality, efficiency, and even security.</p>

                        <p>For many of us, the first step was to simply get our Java application up and running as
                            expected within a container, and Docker was our tool of choice. Now it's time to review what
                            you have implemented and make some improvements. Containerizing our Java applications is
                            fairly straightforward with the latest container aware versions, but there are still
                            pitfalls that can trip you up if you don't know where to look. This session will dive into
                            the best practices of packing your Java container images efficiently and effectively for the
                            trip to production. You will learn valuable information about cloud-native tools available
                            today for building and running containers (including Docker alternatives), container image
                            formats, image storage concerns, and common gotchas to avoid.</p>
