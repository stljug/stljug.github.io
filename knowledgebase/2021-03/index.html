                        <p>Kubernetes is much more than a run time platform for Docker containers. Through its API not
                            only can you create custom clients, but you can also extend Kubernetes. Those custom
                            Controllers are called Operators and work with application-specific custom resource
                            definitions. Containerizing your Java applications is fairly straightforward with the latest
                            container aware versions, but there are still pitfalls that can trip you up if you don't
                            know where to look. This session will dive into the best practices of packing your Java
                            container images efficiently and effectively for the trip to production. You will learn
                            valuable information about cloud-native tools available today for building and running
                            containers (including Docker alternatives), container image formats, image storage concerns,
                            and common gotchas to avoid.</p>
