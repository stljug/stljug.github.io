                        <p>This talk will focus on how engineering teams can leverage automated refactoring tools that
                            originated at Netflix to greatly reduce the time and effort required when migrating to new
                            versions of frameworks like Spring and JUnit and between language versions.</p>

                        <p>Does this Scenario sound familiar?</p>

                        <p>Your organization has many applications that are critical for the day-to-day operation of
                            your business. Over time, you find that your applications have a large number of
                            dependencies on third-party technologies and libraries that have different release cadences.
                            Invariably, your organization encounters pressures to upgrade those dependencies for any
                            number of the following reasons: critical bug fixes, security updates, expiring support,
                            "modernization", or technical enablement. Refactoring a single application to update its
                            third-party dependencies can be tricky and often requires manual intervention when there are
                            breaking changes. At the organization level, performing the same refactoring operation
                            across all of your applications can result in weeks or months of effort.</p>

                        <p>This talk introduces OpenRewrite, an open source ecosystem that specializes in mass,
                            automated refactoring with a focus on Java source code, Maven build files, XML, YAML, and
                            property files. We will discuss how the framework enables the creation of composable,
                            prepackaged recipes that can be used to automate common framework migration and how these
                            recipes can be integrated into both Maven and Gradle builds. This talk will include some
                            live demonstrations of Rewrite's tools to perform automated migrations on real-world, Spring
                            applications and libraries.</p>
