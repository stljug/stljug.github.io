                        <p>Title: Surviving Dependency Hell with Maven</p>

                        <p>As a developer advocate working with customers, Ray has seen all
                            sorts of issues due to dependency conflicts. Dependency conflicts come in many different
                            forms and have different impacts on your applications. This presentation examines common
                            causes of a dependency conflict, how you can mitigate it as a library developer, and how end
                            users can resolve it. It also covers what Google has been documenting in terms of best
                            practices and what tools it has created to help, based on its learnings.</p>

                        <p>Title: Taming Dependency Conflicts for 70 Google Cloud Java Client Libraries</p>

                        <p>At Google Cloud, we have 70+ Java client libraries, each with 20+
                            direct dependencies, and many more transitive dependencies! Keeping all the library
                            dependencies in sync and up to date is a big challenge. Join this talk, to learn about how
                            we manage 70 client libraries in a multi-repo setting, and also aligning dependency versions
                            with best practices, and other techniques to eliminate dependency conflicts for our
                            users.</p>
