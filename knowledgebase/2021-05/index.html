                        <p>Microservice architectures are all the rage in JavaLand. They allow teams to develop services
                            independently and deploy autonomously.</p>

                        <p>Why microservices?<br/>
                            IF<br/>
                            you are developing a large/complex application<br/>
                            AND<br/>
                            you need to deliver it rapidly, frequently, and reliably over a long period of time<br/>
                            THEN<br/>
                            the Microservice Architecture is often a good choice.</p>

                        <p>Reactive architectures are becoming increasingly popular for organizations that need to do
                            more, with
                            less hardware. Reactive programming allows you to build systems that are resilient to high
                            load.

                        <p>In this session, I'll show you how to use JHipster to create a reactive microservices
                            architecture with
                            Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Keycloak, and run it all in Docker. You will leave with the
                            know-how to
                            create your own resilient apps!</p>
